**Face Emotion Recognition**
This project uses OpenCV and the FER (Facial Emotion Recognition) library to detect and display emotions from a webcam feed in real-time.

ðŸŽ¯ **Introduction**
This project demonstrates how to use OpenCV for capturing video frames from a webcam and the FER library for detecting facial emotions in real-time. The detected emotions are displayed on the screen along with bounding boxes around detected faces.

âœ¨ **Features**
* Real-time emotion detection from a webcam feed.
* Display of the most prominent emotion and its score for each detected face.
* Bounding boxes around detected faces.
* Easy-to-use and extend

ðŸš€ **Usage**
To run the emotion detection script, simply execute the following command:

python detect_emotions.py
